# Hang Outs

created by Anthony Chen

This project is using Python/Django for back-end, with ReactJS and JavaScript for the front-end. I also used Semantic UI React mixed with Bootstrap for styling and Animate CSS Library for animations.

I built this project to mimic the functions of https://www.meetup.com/ and the objective was to allow people to network as well as stay in touch.
